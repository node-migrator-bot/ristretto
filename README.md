Ristretto
=========

A simple dependency management and javascript concatenation library.

Install
-------

    npm install ristretto

Usage
-----

Ristretto `exports` only one method, namely `bundle`. Its options are passed as
an object with the following keys.

All keys but `main` are optional

 * `main`       : the main file to compile, all dependencies will be resolved and
                  bundled in the right order after being wrapped in a fake
                  CommonJS environment.
 * `target`     : javascript output file, if undefined, the function call returns
                  the output.
 * `raw`        : additionnal files to include without any wrapping/processing.
                  This can be useful to include libraries such as web frameworks
                  which are not CommonJS compatible. Those files are added in
                  order.
 * `minify`     : if set to `true`, will run the concatenated output through 
                  [uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS)
 * `libraries`  : a module-filename mapping for absolute requires, e.g. `util` 
                  which does not make sense in a browser context.
 * `copyright`  : a comment to be added to the top of the output file.

Example
-------

    ristretto = require 'ristretto'
    ristretto.bundle
      target    : 'target.js'
      main      : 'app.coffee'
      raw       : ['globals.js', 'jquery.min.js', 'etc.js']
      minify    : true
      libraries :
        util : 'libraries/util.js'
        foo  : process.ENV['HOME']+'/.node_libraries/foo'
